# Command Reference

For any command, you can access the help documentation via the CLI:

```bash
hokusai --help
hokusai {command} --help
```

You can add `-v` / `--verbose` to most commands which will show you details of
the individual commands Hokusai will run.

For an interactive console session, run `hokusai console`. All commands are
available within the session. Use TAB to autocomplete Hokusai commands and
`:help` for console help.

### Configuring Hokusai for your organization

- `hokusai configure` - installs and configures kubectl

Required options:

- `--kubectl-version`: The version of your Kubernetes clusters
- `--s3-bucket`: The S3 bucket containing your organization's kubectl config
  file
- `--s3-key`: The S3 key of your organization's kubectl config file

Hokusai uses `kubectl` to connect to Kubernetes and the
[boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3) library to interact with AWS ECR.

Make sure you have set the environment variables `$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
`$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` in your shell / `~/.bash_profile`.

`hokusai configure` provides basic setup for installing and configuring kubectl:

```bash
hokusai configure --help
```

The recommended approach is to upload your `kubectl` config to S3 and use
following command to install it:

```bash
hokusai configure --kubectl-version <kubectl version> --s3-bucket <bucket name> --s3-key <file key>
```

### Setting up a project

- `hokusai setup` - Writes hokusai project config to `hokusai/config.yml`,
  creates test, development and production YAML files alongside it, adds a
  Dockerfile to the current directory, and creates a project ECR repo.

When running `hokusai setup` `staging.yml` and `production.yml` are created in
the `./hokusai` project directory. These files define configuration for a
staging / production Kubernetes context that you are assumed to have available,
and Hokusai is opinionated about a workflow between a staging and a production
Kubernetes context.

Note: `hokusai staging` `hokusai production` subcommands such as `create`,
`update`, `env`, `deploy` and `logs` reference the respective environment YAML
file and interacts with the respective Kubernetes context.

- `hokusai check` - Checks that Hokusai dependencies are correctly installed and
  configured for the current project.

### Local development

- `hokusai dev` - Interact with docker-compose targeting the development
  environment defined in ./hokusai/development.yml
  - `hokusai dev start` - Start the development environment defined in
    `./hokusai/development.yml`.
  - `hokusai dev stop` - Stop the development environment defined in
    `./hokusai/development.yml`.
  - `hokusai dev status` - Print the status of the development environment.
  - `hokusai dev logs` - Print logs from the development environment.
  - `hokusai dev run` - Run a command in the development environment's container
    with the name 'project-name' in hokusai/config.yml.
  - `hokusai dev clean` - Stop and remove all containers in the environment.

### Testing and building images

- `hokusai test` - Start the testing environment defined `hokusai/test.yml` and
  exit with the return code of the test command.
- `hokusai build` - Build the docker image defined in ./hokusai/build.yml.

### Managing images in the registry

- `hokusai registry` - Interact with the project registry.
  - `hokusai registry push` - Build and push an image to the project registry.
  - `hokusai registry images` - Print image builds and tags in the project
    registry.

### Working with remotely deployed Kubernetes environments

- `hokusai [staging|production]` - Interact with remote Kubernetes resources.

- `hokusai [staging|production] create` - Create the Kubernetes resources
  defined in the environment config, either `./hokusai/staging.yml` or
  `./hokusai/production.yml`.
- `hokusai [staging|production] update` - Update the Kubernetes resources
  defined in the environment config.
- `hokusai [staging|production] delete` - Delete the Kubernetes resources
  defined in the environment config.
- `hokusai [staging|production] status` - Print the Kubernetes resources status
  defined in the environment config.

- `hokusai [staging|production] deploy` - Update the project's deployment(s) for
  a given environment to reference the given image tag and update the tag
  (staging/production) to reference the same image.
- `hokusai [staging|production] [refresh|restart]` - Refresh the project's
  deployment(s) by recreating the currently running containers.

- `hokusai [staging|production] env` - Interact with the runtime environment for
  the application

  - `hokusai [staging|production] env create` - Create the Kubernetes configmap
    object `{project_name}-environment`
  - `hokusai [staging|production] env get` - Print environment variables stored
    on the Kubernetes server
  - `hokusai [staging|production] env set` - Set environment variables on the
    Kubernetes server. Environment variables are stored for the project as
    key-value pairs in the Kubernetes configmap object
    `{project_name}-environment`
  - `hokusai [staging|production] env unset` - Remove environment variables
    stored on the Kubernetes server
  - `hokusai [staging|production] env delete` - Delete the Kubernetes configmap
    object `{project_name}-environment`

- `hokusai [staging|production] run` - Launch a container and run a given
  command. It exits with the status code of the command run in the container
  (useful for `rake` tasks, etc). Use single quotes around your command string
  if it contains whitespace.
  - Use the flag `--tty` to attach your terminal, if your command is
    interactive. E.g. `hokusai production run --tty 'bundle exec rails c'`
    launches an interactive console for a Rails project.
  - The flag `--help` shows other flags that might be helpful.
- `hokusai [staging|production] logs` - Print the logs from your application
  containers

### Working with review apps

Review apps can be created and managed with `hokusai review_app`.

See full details in the [Review App reference](Review_Apps.md).

### Working with the Staging -> Production pipeline

- `hokusai pipeline` - Interact with the project's' staging -> production
  pipeline
  - `hokusai pipeline gitdiff` - Print a git diff between the tags deployed on
    production vs staging.
  - `hokusai pipeline gitlog` - Print a git log comparing the tags deployed on
    production vs staging, can be used to see what commits are going to be
    promoted.
  - `hokusai pipeline gitcompare --org-name <your org name in githug>` - Print a
    git compare url for comparing whats on staging with production.
  - `hokusai pipeline promote` - Update the project's deployment(s) on
    production with the image tag currently deployed on staging and update the
    production tag to reference the same image.

### How to do a rollback

You can use the command `hokusai registry images` to get a list of all images
for your current project. They order from most recent to oldest. To do a
rollback use `hokusai production deploy [image_tag]` to get back to a particular
version.
